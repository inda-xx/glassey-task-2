              \n\n - `AMA` (ask me anything): I will ask you a question about your code
              \n\n - `Hint X.Y`: I will try to give you a hint about a particular exercise
              \n\n - `Mend X.java`: I will give you code quality tips for the given Java file
              \n\n - `Rate`: I will try to give a soft grade decision based on the task and code in the repo
              \n\n - `More`: I will invent a new exercise based on the current task
              \n\n - `Lang X`: I will rewrite the task for language X
