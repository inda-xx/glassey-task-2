                \n\n - \`AMA\` (ask me anything): I will ask you a random question about your code
                \n - \`Hint X.Y\`: I will try to give you a hint about a particular exercise
                \n - \`Mend X.java\`: I will give you code quality tips for the given Java file
                \n - \`Rate\`: I will try to give a soft grade decision based on the task and code in the repo
                \n - \`More\`: I will invent a new exercise based on the current task
                \n - \`Lang X\`: I will rewrite the task for language X
                \n\n I'll try my best to respond, but be patient as I am a bit slow ðŸ¤–
